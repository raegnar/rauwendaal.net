Another nice collections of links and papers too valuable to lose among all my bookmarks.  This time on physically-based rendering, put together by Kostas Anagnostou ([\@thinkinggamer](https://twitter.com/thinkinggamer)).

List maintained and updated over at his blog [Interplay of Light](http://interplayoflight.wordpress.com/):
