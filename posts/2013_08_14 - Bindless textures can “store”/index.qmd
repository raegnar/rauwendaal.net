I don\'t know how I missed this when Nvidia released [`NV_bindless_texture`](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/bindless_texture.txt), I guess because all the samples I saw used bindless textures to demonstrate a ridiculous number of texture reads. But I realized when reading the recently released [`ARB_bindless_texture`](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/bindless_texture.txt) extension that they can also be used to \"store,\" or write, to a very large number of textures (using [`ARB_shader_image_load_store`](http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/shader_image_load_store.txt) functionality). Which finally gets rid of that extremely pesky `MAX_IMAGE_UNITS` limitation I\'ve been complaining about. The only downside is that I can no longer run my program at home on my GTX 480.
