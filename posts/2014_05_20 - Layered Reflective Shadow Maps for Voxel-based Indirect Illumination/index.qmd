So, a lot has happened. I completed my [Doctorate](https://rauwendaal.net/phd-thesis/),
almost moved to Norway, but then ended up moving to Canada instead
(Victoria, BC). I now work for the Advanced Technology Group at Intel,
where I was very fortunate enough  to have the opportunity to assist a
new colleague of mine, Masamichi Sugihara ([\@masasugihara](https://twitter.com/masasugihara)), with his publication \"[Layered Reflective Shadow Maps for Voxel-based Indirect Illumination](https://rauwendaal.net/layered-reflective-shadow-maps-for-voxel-based-indirect-illumination/ "Layered Reflective Shadow Maps for Voxel-based Indirect Illumination"),\" which has been accepted to [HPG 2014](http://www.highperformancegraphics.org/2014/program/).

> We introduce a novel voxel-based algorithm that
> interactively simulates both diffuse and glossy single-bounce indirect
> illumination. Our algorithm generates high quality images similar to the
> reference solution while using only a fraction of the memory of
> previous methods. The key idea in our work is to decouple occlusion
> data, stored in voxels, from lighting and geometric data, encoded in a
> new per-light data structure called layered reflective shadow maps
> (LRSMs). We use voxel cone tracing for visibility determination and
> integrate outgoing radiance by performing lookups in a pre-filtered
> LRSM. Finally we demonstrate that our simple data structures are easy to
> implement and can be rebuilt every frame to support both dynamic lights
> and scenes.

### **Hire Masamichi!**

Due to some rather shortsighted reorganization, Masasmichi is currently pursuing employment opportunities that will either; allow him to stay in Canada, or return to Japan. If you are interested in hiring a top-notch graphics coder, please get in touch.
